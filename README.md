# pivotal-tracker-clj

A Clojure library designed to wrap Pivotal Tracker's API.

This library doesn't do anything for any specific endpoints.

We figure that you will appreciate help with:
- Authentication
- Handling request vs. API parameters
- Pagination and parallelisation of API calls
- Error handling (such as hitting an API rate limit)

We figure that you don't need help with:
- Reading documentation on endpoints and parameters https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5
- Making dates and times (Highly recommend the `clj-time` library for this)

## Usage

`(require '[pivotal-tracker-clj.core :as pt])`

The main function is `api!` and takes two required arguments, one optional argument and unlimited named parameters.

There is also a convenience function `api!!` that works exactly the same as `api!` but relies on the token to be set as an environment variable (do not pass the API token as the first argument to `api!!`).

### API key

The first argument is an API token for Pivotal tracker.

There is a utility function `pivotal-tracker-clj.core/token` that will attempt to extract the token from the environment variable `PIVOTAL_TRACKER_TOKEN`.

### Endpoint

The endpoint can be provided as either:

- An absolute URL e.g. `https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5/projects/12345/stories`
- A relative path e.g. `projects/12345/stories`
- A vector of path components e.g. `["projects" 12345 "stories"]`

### Options

A hash map of options to be passed to the Pivotal Tracker API as per the documentation.

The options map will be treated differently depending on the HTTP method used, as per Pivotal Tracker's requirements.

For example, GET requests must use query parameters whereas POST requests are expected to provide JSON in the body.

No validation is attempted to ensure that the options passed are sensible for the given endpoint - please reference the documentation for this.

The options map is an optional argument to `api!`.

Example, get all stories created after 2016-01-01:

```clojure
(pivotal-tracker-clj.core/api!  (pivotal-tracker-clj.core/token)
                                ["projects" 123456 "stories"]
                                {:created_after "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z"})
```

### Params

Additional parameters to `http-kit` can be passed in as named parameters.

Notably, this allows for control over the HTTP method used.

Example, create a new story named "test post":

```clojure
(pivotal-tracker-clj.core/api!  (pivotal-tracker-clj.core/token)
                                ["projects" 123456 "stories"]
                                {:name "test post"}
                                :method :post))
```
